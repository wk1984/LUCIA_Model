Land Use Change Identification and Analysis Model

This is a working Planning Support Systems that identifies past land use changes in urban areas based on changes to parcel boundaries combined with changes to parcels structural characteristics.
It is currently programmed using King County, WA data.  I am working to make it more flexible to apply to any set of county GIS and parcel specific data.
